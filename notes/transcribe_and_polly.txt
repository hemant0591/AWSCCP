You can use Amazon Transcribe to add speech-to-text capability to your applications. Amazon Transcribe uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately. Amazon Transcribe can be used to transcribe customer service calls, to automate closed captioning and subtitling, and to generate metadata for media assets.



You can use Amazon Polly to turn text into lifelike speech thereby allowing you to create applications that talk. Polly's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech.



Amazon Translate is used for language translation. Amazon Translate uses neural machine translation via deep learning models to deliver more accurate and more natural-sounding translation than traditional statistical and rule-based translation algorithms.
